"""Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you
can create a project in Django?


High-level Framework: 

    Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. 


Batteries-Included:

    Django follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a wide range of built-in features and tools out of the box. 
    These include an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction, a powerful URL routing system, 
    an easy-to-use templating engine, form handling, user authentication, and an admin interface for site management.

Scalability: 

    Django is designed to scale from small projects to large, high-traffic websites with ease. 
    Its architecture allows for efficient handling of concurrent requests, making it suitable for building applications that need to serve a large number of users simultaneously. 
    Django's scalability is demonstrated by its use in powering some of the busiest sites on the internet.

Security :

     Django's built-in security features, combined with best practices recommended by the framework, 
     make it easier for developers to create web applications that are resistant to attacks.


Community and Ecosystem: 

    Django has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, provide support, and share resources.


Documentation: 

    Django is well-documented, with comprehensive official documentation that covers all aspects of the framework, 
    including tutorials, guides, and reference materials.
